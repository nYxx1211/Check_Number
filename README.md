# Check_Number
This Phyton program determines whether a given number is odd or even.  I created this by only using Thonny, and a handout that was given to me by my professor.
In this activity, students will create a function called check_number(num), which determines whether a given number is odd or even. The function will use an if-else statement to check if the number is divisible by 2 using the modulo operator (%). If the remainder when divided by 2 is 0, it means the number is even, otherwise, it is odd. When calling check_number(4), the program should print "4 is an Even number.", whereas calling check_number(7) should print "7 is an Odd number.". The function should also work with negative numbers and zero. This activity helps students practice using mathematical operations, conditional logic, and function calls in Python.
